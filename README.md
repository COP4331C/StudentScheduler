# UCanFinish Student Scheduler
## Course Schedule + Planner app for students (for Richard Leinecker's COP4331C class, oriented towards UCF students)

Designed using the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack. Previously hosted on a free AWS instance.

Project is partially complete:
  + Full API functionality
  + Complete front-end/UX design
  - Front-end does not properly communicate with the database to populate student events + tasks
  - (landing2.html provides a more visually functional front-end, landing.html provides a more complex front-end that demonstrates basic communication with the API).
  
## Running this project:
You will need a GNU/Linux machine running the Apache HTTP server and MySQL database server.

API expects a database with the following structure:
<insert here i guess>
